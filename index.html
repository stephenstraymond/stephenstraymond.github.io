					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>Stephen is currently a third year mechanical engineering student	at Drexel University.  He began his engineering career with a six month co-op position at the LaFrance Corporation, where he worked as a project manager for the golf team.  He is currently working as an electromechanical engineer for the Parker Hannifin Corporation, where he is working in a lab to test and review various flow scenarios for precision control instruments.</p>
					<p>Outside of work, Stephen pursues a number of hobbies.  After running track and cross country in high school, Stephen continues to run in his spare time, occasionally participating in local 5 kilometer races.  During the Winter, Stephen typically turns to seasonal sports such as skiing and snowboarding for exercise.  Since coming to Drexel, Stephen has also developed an interest in electronics, and pursues many small projects in his leisure time, including many seen in the projects section below.</p>

					<h3>Projects</h3>
					<p>Stephen's first experience with engineering projects began with the Rube Goldberg challenge in the Drexel University Engineering 10x sequence.  During this challenge, Stephen worked in a group with two other students to design and build a Rube Goldberg machine capable of performing 6 energy-transfer tasks on its own, while also being capable of integrating into a class-wide Rube Goldberg machine.</p>
					<p>After the Rube Goldberg machine in Engineering 101, Stephen continued to work in 3 person teams of Drexel students for Engineering 102 and 103.  In ENGR 102, Stephen was responsible for the programming of a LEGO Mindstorms robot, which was capable of locating and identifying blue and yellow canisters in a competition arena and delivering them to their respective delivery zones.  This was Stephen's first experience with programming, and led to his initial interest in this field.  In ENGR 103, Stephen was able to further develop his skills in programming, and learn new skills such as circuit design and soldering, during the design and assembly of an LED Smart Juggling Ball.</p>
					<p>Stephen continues to hone his skills in engineering design and prototyping with his own projects, such as the RFID Controlled Door Lock.  Developed for personal use, the RFID Controlled Door Lock uses the ID-12LA RFID reader to scan 125 kHz tags presented, while a SparkFun RedBoard (powered by Arduino) reads the data input and controls a servo motor to lock and unlock a standard deadbolt.</p>

					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>As Stephen approaches graduation from Drexel University, his academic goals include fulfilling the requirements for his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics, as well his Master of Science degree in the same field.  Since late 2015, Stephen has also been taking classes for a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus on electrical engineering systems.  Stephen chose this minor based on his interest in electrical engineering, as well as the practical applications of electrical engineering skills within the mechanical engineering field.  Since Fall of the 2016 academic year, Stephen has also been taking graduate classes alongside his undergraduate classes, as a part of Drexel's BS/MS accelerated degree program.  Through this program, Stephen will graduate in June of 2019 with both his B.S. and M.S. in the field of Mechanical Engineering.</p>
					<p>After graduation, Stephen hopes to pursue a career in the field of aerospace engineering.  Since he was a kid, Stephen dreamed of being an astronaut, and loved watching the Space Shuttle launches on TV.  Now, Stephen has turned his interest towards the science and engineering behind each launch, and dreams of being apart of the industry that is pushing humanity to explore more regions of space than ever before.  While Stephen still hopes to become an astronaut one day, his goals today are to work on the rockets and spacecraft of the future, and do everything he can to help humanity establish a larger presence in space.</p>
